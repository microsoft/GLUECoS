Top Alexa Ranking ke hisaab se Agar aapki Website ki Rank Worldwide 1 Lakh se kam hain toh Yeh bahut hi badhiya hain. Kyonki 1 Lakh se kam Alexa Ranking wali Website ko Top Website wala mana gaya hain. Alexa 1 lakh se kam ranking wali website ka sahi se ranking bhi deti hain. Lekin Kisi Website ka 1,00,000 se kam Alexa ranking ko pana Website ke high traffic par depend karta hain. Agar aapki Website sach mein 1,00,000 Ranking se kam hain toh sach mein aap great ho.

Alexa ranking acchi karne ke liye aap apne blog/website ko daily update karte rahe. Isliye aap apne blog/website par daily naye articles likhte rahe. Agar aap apne blog par daily article nahi likhenge toh aapke website ki alexa rank gir jati hain. Isliye Blog par hamesha nayi post jaroor likhte rahna chahiye. 3. Alexa Ranking ko increase karne ke liye jaroori hain ki aapke website par computer users ka traffic zyada aana jaroori hain. Kyonki agar aapki website par zyada computer/Laptop users visit karenge toh Alexa ranking aur bhi tezi ke saath increase karegi. 4. Alexa Ranking increase karne ke liye jaroori hain ki apni site ko attractive banaye, Jisse jyada users aapki website par aayenge aur zyada traffic ki wajah se Alexa Rank increase karegi. 5. Alexa Ranking ka Widget aap apne website par lagaye, Isse Alexa ko aapke website ko sahi rank karne mein madad milegi. 6. Koshish kare ki aapki website 1,00,000 ke under ho isse alexa sahi ranking deta hain. 7. Apni Website ka bounce rate kam karne ki koshish kare. Bounce rate vah hota hain jisse hame pata chalta hain ki aapki website par koi user aapki website par kitna waqt deta hain. Matlab ki aapki website par koi user kitna der tak thaharta hain. Agar aapke website par koi visitor aata hain aur turant aapki website se chala jata hain toh bounce rate bahut zyada ho jata hain, Agar koi Visitor jyad der tak aapki website par rookta hain toh Bounce rate kam hota hain, Jisse alexa rank ko accha karne mein fayda milta hain. 8. Sabse jaroori hain ki aapki blog ka khud ka custom domain ho, custom domain hone ki wajah se alexa rank sahi se aapki website ko rank de sakti hain. Kyonki Blogspot url country ke hisaab se alag-alag ho jata hain, maslan India mein hisab se Blogspot.in, England ke hisaab se Blogspot.co.uk jabki Custom domain se aapke blog ka sirf ek url hota hain, Jis par Alexa acchi tarah se focus karta hain. Alexa rank ki kamiya : - 1. Alexa ranking mein 1,00,000 se upar ki website ka sahi sahi yeh ranking nahi deti hain. 2.

Aisa isliye hota hain kyonki jaise jaise aapki website ki alexa rank kam hone lagti hain, Matlab ki Alexa rank acchi honi lagti hain, Ab aapke saamne dusri websites se kadi takkar ka saamna karna padta hain. Matlab ki aapse aage wali websites bhi top ki websites hoti hain. Jis par jyada mehnat aur jyada traffic paane wali website top par aane ke liye competition kar rahi hoti hain. Yani ki high quality aur high traffic wali website baazi maar leti hain.

They thought propeller design would be a simple matter and intended to adapt data from shipbuilding . However , their library research disclosed no established formulae for either marine or air propellers , and they found themselves with no sure starting point . They discussed and argued the question , sometimes heatedly , until they concluded that an aeronautical propeller is essentially a wing rotating in the vertical plane . On that basis , they used data from more wind tunnel tests to design their propellers . The finished blades were just over eight feet long , made of three laminations of glued spruce .

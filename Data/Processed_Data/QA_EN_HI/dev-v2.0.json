Alexa Rank veh rank hoti hain jo Alexa ki website kisi website ko ranking deti hain. Example ke taur maan lijiye hum sabhi students hain aur exam dene baad hamare dwara prapt kiye gye exam marks ke base par hamari apni class mein rank aata hain, Jaise ki koi 1st aata hain aur koi second aata hain, Kisi bhi Board/University ke exam ke baad marks ke according Students ki Merit List aur Ranking hoti hain. Usi tarah se Alexa bhi world ke har blog aur Website ki ranking , oos website/blog par aane wale daily traffic ke mutabik set karti hain. Matlab Alexa Rank ke jariye aap samajh sakte hain ki koi Website/Blog world mein kitna famous hain. Koi blog/website kaun se desh mein kitna popular hain. Alexa traffic ke hisaab se har website ko rank deta hain. Isse pata chalta hain ki koi website kitne paaydaan (Position) par hain. Alexa Kisi blog aur Website ko 2 tarah ki Ranking deti hain, Pahli rank Worldwide hoti hain, Jiska matlab yeh hota hain ki aapki website aur aapka blog Duniya mein kitna popular hain aur world mein iski kya position hain. Dusra Rank Country wise hota hain, Jiska matlab yeh hain ki aapke Blog/Website par agar kisi ek country ka zyada traffic aata ho toh veh Alexa Rank yeh show karti hain ki oos country mein aapki website ka Rank kya hain. Duniya bhar ke Advertiser bhi Alexa rank ko kisi website ki popularity ka paimana mante hain. Acchi Alexa ranking hone se Advertiser khud b khud aapki website par khiche chale aate hain. Kisi website ki alexa rank kitni honi chahiye ? Kisi website ki Alexa Rank jitni kam hogi, Website ke liye utna hi accha hain. Top Alexa Ranking ke hisaab se Agar aapki Website ki Rank Worldwide 1 Lakh se kam hain toh Yeh bahut hi badhiya hain. Kyonki 1 Lakh se kam Alexa Ranking wali Website ko Top Website wala mana gaya hain. Alexa 1 lakh se kam ranking wali website ka sahi se ranking bhi deti hain. Lekin Kisi Website ka 1,00,000 se kam Alexa ranking ko pana Website ke high traffic par depend karta hain. Agar aapki Website sach mein 1,00,000 Ranking se kam hain toh sach mein aap great ho. Alexa kaise tay karta hain kisi website ki ranking? Alexa kisi bhi website ki ranking oos website par aane wale daily traffic ke mutabik tay karta hain. Aur yehi wajah hain ki har website ki Alexa ranking har din kam-jyada hoti rahti hain, Kyonki har website par har din kam-jyada traffic aata rahta hain. Isliye Alexa ranking ka paimana website ki traffic hain. Alexa Ranking ko increase karne (Badhane) ke tips. Alexa Ranking ko Increase (Badhane) ke tips ki jagah agar hum Alexa rank ko kam karne ki tips kahe toh zyada accha rahega. Kyonki Alexa rank jitni kam hogi utna hi accha hain. Yani ki Alexa rank ko Kam karne ki tips jante hain. 1. Alexa Rank Traffic par depend hota hain, Isliye koshish kare ki aap apni website par zyada se zyada visitors ko attract kare. 2. Alexa ranking acchi karne ke liye aap apne blog/website ko daily update karte rahe. Isliye aap apne blog/website par daily naye articles likhte rahe. Agar aap apne blog par daily article nahi likhenge toh aapke website ki alexa rank gir jati hain. Isliye Blog par hamesha nayi post jaroor likhte rahna chahiye. 3. Alexa Ranking ko increase karne ke liye jaroori hain ki aapke website par computer users ka traffic zyada aana jaroori hain. Kyonki agar aapki website par zyada computer/Laptop users visit karenge toh Alexa ranking aur bhi tezi ke saath increase karegi. 4. Alexa Ranking increase karne ke liye jaroori hain ki apni site ko attractive banaye, Jisse jyada users aapki website par aayenge aur zyada traffic ki wajah se Alexa Rank increase karegi. 5. Alexa Ranking ka Widget aap apne website par lagaye, Isse Alexa ko aapke website ko sahi rank karne mein madad milegi. 6. Koshish kare ki aapki website 1,00,000 ke under ho isse alexa sahi ranking deta hain. 7. Apni Website ka bounce rate kam karne ki koshish kare. Bounce rate vah hota hain jisse hame pata chalta hain ki aapki website par koi user aapki website par kitna waqt deta hain. Matlab ki aapki website par koi user kitna der tak thaharta hain. Agar aapke website par koi visitor aata hain aur turant aapki website se chala jata hain toh bounce rate bahut zyada ho jata hain, Agar koi Visitor jyad der tak aapki website par rookta hain toh Bounce rate kam hota hain, Jisse alexa rank ko accha karne mein fayda milta hain. 8. Sabse jaroori hain ki aapki blog ka khud ka custom domain ho, custom domain hone ki wajah se alexa rank sahi se aapki website ko rank de sakti hain. Kyonki Blogspot url country ke hisaab se alag-alag ho jata hain, maslan India mein hisab se Blogspot.in, England ke hisaab se Blogspot.co.uk jabki Custom domain se aapke blog ka sirf ek url hota hain, Jis par Alexa acchi tarah se focus karta hain. Alexa rank ki kamiya : - 1. Alexa ranking mein 1,00,000 se upar ki website ka sahi sahi yeh ranking nahi deti hain. 2. Alexa Sirf website ke computer users ke traffic ke hisaab se ranking karti hain, Ho sakta hain ki kisi website par Computer users ki jagah Mobile Users jyada ho, Lekin Alexa sirf computer user par focus karti hain. Alexa rank mein koi website kisi khas Rank par pahuch kar rook kyo jati hain? Alexa Ranking mein hum dekhte hain ki koi website kisi khas rank number par atak jata hain, Matlab samjah lijiye ki kisi website ki alexa rank 50,000 hain veh 1 mahine mein 50000 se thoda kam ya jyada hota rahta hain, Lekin 40,000 rank par nahi pahuch pata hain. Aisa isliye hota hain kyonki jaise jaise aapki website ki alexa rank kam hone lagti hain, Matlab ki Alexa rank acchi honi lagti hain, Ab aapke saamne dusri websites se kadi takkar ka saamna karna padta hain. Matlab ki aapse aage wali websites bhi top ki websites hoti hain. Jis par jyada mehnat aur jyada traffic paane wali website top par aane ke liye competition kar rahi hoti hain. Yani ki high quality aur high traffic wali website baazi maar leti hain. Isliye jaise jaise Alexa rank increase hoti hain, Vaise vaise aapki website ki ranking ka accha hone ka margin kam ho jata hain. Yahi wajah hain ki aapki website kisi khas ranking mein atak jati hain. Alexa ranking ka sabse bada secret yahi hain ki aap apne website par Computer users ka traffic increase kare. Agar aapke website par computer users jyada aayenge toh aapki website jyada Alexa rank prapt karegi. Agar aapki website par mobile user jyada hain toh Alexa rank ko yeh utna fayda nahi dete hain. Computer User hi Alexa ranking ke liye jaroori hain."}]}, {"title": 89, "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "alexa kya hai?", "id": 89, "answers": [{"text": "website", "answer_start": 9}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 111}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 124}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 545}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 722}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 799}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 855}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 1028}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 1315}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 1390}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 1492}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 1533}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 1581}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 1890}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 2157}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 2192}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 2215}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 2305}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 2376}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 2463}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 2843}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 2947}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 3004}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 3110}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 3275}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 3356}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 3579}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 3693}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 3733}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 3804}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 3989}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 4016}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 4066}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 4127}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 4178}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 4283}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 4514}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 4860}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 4923}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 5015}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 5147}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 5247}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 5326}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 5515}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 5624}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 5702}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 5722}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 5792}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 5896}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 5994}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 6080}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 6184}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 6248}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 6299}, {"text": "website", "answer_start": 6349}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Alexa ek website hain jo Amazon company ki taraf se banayi gyi hain.

Yeh Kitna tez hoga, Kitna Mehnga hoga, Kaha-kaha milega, Kaise chalega aur bhi kai swaal hain.Inme se 10 main questions aur unke answer diye ja rahe hain.1. 4G sachmuch kitna fast hain?Agar aap Bharat mein 4G connection lete hain to aapko 3G ke mukable bahut behtar Speed milegi. Airtel 4G par 6-8 MBPS ki speed milti hain, Jabki Airtel ke 3G par 1-3 MBPS ki speed milti hain. Lekin jaise-jaise log 4G ka istemal badhayenge, Vaise-Vaise iski speed kam hoti chali jayegi, Khas-karke Delhi jaise busy cities mein. Aisa hi 3G ke saath bhi hua tha. 2. Kya mera Handset ise support karega ?Agar aapne Isi saal latest phone khareeda hain to ummeed hain ki 4G support karega. Lekin yeh aapke operator ke 4G Network par kaam karega ya nahi, Yeh janane ke liye aapko apne operator se puchna hoga. Airtel ke liye aap unki website par apna number daal kar pata kar sakte hain. Is samay market mein bahut se 4G Handset mauzood hain. Inme Samsung, Motorola, Micromax, Xiaomi aur dusri companies ke smartphone hain. Inme se kuch to 10,000 rupaye se bhi kam keemat ke hain.Agar aapka Handset aapke operator ke 4G par kaam nahi karta to ise 3G par kaam karna chahiye.3. Kya ispar Paisa kharch kare ?Agar aap mobile se Internet ka use karte hain to 4G par paisa kharch karna accha ho sakta hain, Khas-karke tab jabki yeh 3G ki keemat mein mil raha hain. Halaki baad mein iske rate badhaye ja sakte hain, Lekin iski sambhavna kam hain. Iski wajah yeh hain ki competition badh gya hain. 4G bahut shandar Portable Broadband bhi hain aur 4G Dongle ke saath ghar mein istemal ke liye temporary option bhi ban sakta hain. 4. India mein sabse pahli 4G service kaun si thi?August 2015 tak 296 cities aur areas mein 4G Mobile Service shuru karke Airtel saaf taur par Reliance Geo aur Vodafone se aage nikal gya hain. Airtel hi pahli company hain jisne 2012 mein Kolkata mein \"Broadband Wireless Access\" ke liye pahli 4G Service shuru ki thi. Is company ne February 2014 mein Bengaluru mein pahli baar 4G sewa shuru ki thi. August 2014 tak ek aur operator Aircel ne 6 States mein 4G Broadband sewa shuru ki, Lekin yeh gair mobile sewa thi.5. Kya yeh mehnga padega ?Halaki Airtel ne 4G ka rate 3G ke barabar hi rakha hain, Lekin aap jyada kharch kar sakte hain. Isme Data jyada tezi se istemal hota hain. Aap 4G mein jyada Video dekh sakte hain. Yeh 3G ke mukable yeh jyada behtar quality ke hote hain aur asaani se chalte hain. Aap Whatsapp aur Email par jyada tezi se pictures download ya upload kar sakte hain. 6. Mere shahar mein kya yeh kaam karega ?Mumbai aur Gurgaon jaise kai big aur busy cities mein coverage ek jaise nahi hota hain. Kai jagaho par toh Jaroori mobile tower bhi nahi hain. Delhi mein Municipal Corporation ne bahut saare tower hata diye hain. Vaha kuch jagah mobile coverage bahut gadbad ho gyi hain aur lagatar call drops hoti hain. Par yeh problem 4G tak hi simit nahi hain.7. Kya behtar offer ka wait karna chahiye ?Ise lene ka yahi accha samay hain. Airtel 4G users ko kai gift bhi de rahi hain, jaise Unlimited Voice calls, Movies aur Music. Iske alawa iske Wynk mobile app par aap 25,000 movies aur 18 Lakh songs stream kar sakte hain. Iske liye aap Airtel ne Flipkart ke samjhauta kiya hain, Agar aap Flipkart se Koi bhi 4G smartphone khareedte hain to Airtel ka 4G Sim saath mein milta hain.8. Bharat ki tarah ka 4G istemal karta hain ?Bharat LTE naam ki technique ka istemal karta hain jo ki 4G ke liye 2300 MHz Frequency Spectrum par kaam karta hain. LTE pahli baar 2009 mein Europe mein istemal ki gyi thi. Ek aur technique WiMax bahut acchi tarah se nahi chali aur ab kuch ki countries mein iske istemal kiya ja raha hain.9. Kaun-Kaun si companies 4G service shuru kar rahi hain?Mukesh Ambani ki Reliance Geo December 2015 mein 4G service zor-shor se shuru karne ka plan bana rahi hain. Isne 5 years mein Gadgets aur tower install karne ke liye 14 Arab Doller yani ki takreeban 9.20 Kharb rupaye se jyada kharch kiye hain. Dusri aor Airtel ne pichle 20 saal mein gadgets par 15 Arab Dollar yani ki 9.86 Kharab rupaye se jyada kharch kiye hain. Iske alawa isi financial year mein Vodafone aur Idea bhi apne 4G service shuru karenge.10. Paisa bachane ka sabse accha tarika kya hain?Chunki 4G bahut tez hain, Isliye aapko lalach hota hain ki aap jyada pictures aur video download kar le. Isse bachna hi theek rahega. Example ke liye Whatsapp par \"Auto Download Media\" ka option ko Mobile data par band karke rakhna chahiye. Iske saath hi \"Mobile Data Roaming\" setting ko bhi off rakhe.Iske saath hi koshish kare ki jab bhi possible ho to pictures aur Video download karne ke liye Wi-Fi ka istemal kare."}]}, {"title": 137, "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Microsoft ke naye browser ka naam kya hai?", "id": 137, "answers": [{"text": "Microsoft Edge", "answer_start": 280}, {"text": "Microsoft Edge", "answer_start": 554}, {"text": "Microsoft Edge", "answer_start": 1007}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Internet Explorer ko alvida kahne ka waqt ab aa gya hain.

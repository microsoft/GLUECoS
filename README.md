# GLUECoS: An Evaluation Benchmark for Code-Switched NLP
**NEW (Aug - 2020): Evaluation is now automated and results are presented instantly. Please check [this](#submitting-predictions-for-evaluation) section**

This is the repo for the ACL 2020 paper [GLUECoS: An Evaluation Benchmark for Code-Switched NLP](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.329/)

GLUECoS is a benchmark comprising of multiple code-mixed tasks across 2 language pairs (En-Es and En-Hi)

Below are instructions for obtaining the datasets that comprise the benchmark and training transformer based models on this data. Both steps can be run on separate systems and the instructions are structured in such a way. All the user has to do is to copy over the `Data/Processed_Data` folder over to perform training

## Obtaining Datasets
Follow the following instructions to download and process the datasets. All the steps should work in a brand new conda environment with `python==3.6.10` or a docker container with the `python:3.6` image. Please note that the splits for some of the datasets are different from their original releases.
1. Install the requirements for the preprocessing scripts
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Create a twitter developer account and fill in the 4 keys, one per line,  in `twitter_authentication.txt`. The file should look like this
    ```
    consumer_key
    secret_key
    access_token
    access_secret_token
    ```
    
3. Obtain a key for Microsoft Translator. This is needed as the preprocessing steps involve conversion of Romanized datasets into Devanagari. Instructions for obtaining this key can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/translator-how-to-signup). While creating the translator instance, please set the region to global. The number of queries made fall within the free tier. This key will be referred to as SUBSCRIPTION_KEY in the next step
4. To download the data, run the command below. This will download the original datasets, perform all the preprocessing needed and bring them into a format that the training scripts can use
    ```
    ./download_data.sh SUBSCRIPTION_KEY
    ```
    The dowloaded and processed data is stored in `Data/Processed_Data`. 
    
    Some of the datasets did not have predefined splits, so the splits used for those can be found in `Data/Original_Data`.

    Please note that the labels for the test sets are not the gold labels. They have been assigned a separate token to maintain fairness in the benchmarking.

    This will not download/preprocess the QA dataset. For that, please check the next step

5. The original QA dataset (Chandu et. al, 2018) contains contexts only for some examples. To obtain contexts for the rest, [DrQA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DrQA) is used to obtain contexts from a Wikipedia dump. To run this, you will need atleast 20GB of disk storage (to store the wikidump) and 16GB+ of RAM (to run DrQA). DrQA uses PyTorch, so having a GPU will help speed it up (although it isn't necessary).

    First, install a suitable version of PyTorch for your system. In most cases, a `pip install torch` should do

    To download and process the QA dataset, run the following command
    ```
    bash Data/Preprocess_Scripts/preprocess_qa.sh
    ```

## Training models on the data
The code contains 4 different evaluation scripts
1. One script for token level tasks:
    - LID (en_es/en_hi)
    - NER (en_es/en_hi),
    - POS (en_es/en_hi_fg/en_hi_ud)
2. One script for the sentence level tasks:
    - Sentiment (en_es/en_hi)
3. One script for the QA task 
    - QA (en_hi)
4. One script for the NLI task
    - NLI (en_hi)

You can train the models on your system or via Azure Machine Learning. To know more about the latter, please refer to [this README](azure_ml/README.md).

### Install the training requirements  
Note: The requirements for dataset preprocessing and training have been separately mentioned, as you may run them on different systems
1. Install a suitable version of pytorch for your system, `pip install torch` should work in most cases
2. The requirements from the file in `Code/requirements.txt`
    ```
    pip install -r Code/requirements.txt
    ```
### Training
Run the below command to fine-tune your model on any of the task. The training scripts uses the Huggingface library and support any models based on BERT, XLM, XLM-Roberta and similar models.

```
bash train.sh MODEL MODEL_TYPE TASK 
```
Example Usage :
```    
bash train.sh bert-base-multilingual-cased bert POS_EN_HI_FG
```
You can also run fine-tuning for all tasks with the following command :
```
bash train.sh bert-base-multilingual-cased bert ALL
```

## Submitting Predictions for Evaluation
Submission is done by uploading the results to a fork of this repo and making a pull request to the main repo. The evaluation is done automatically by a set of actions that run for the PR.

The training scripts supplied write predictions for the test set into the `Results` folder.
1. Zip this folder into results.zip with `zip results.zip -r Results`.
2. Create a fork of `microsoft/GLUECoS` on Github.
3. Add this `results.zip` file to the root directory of your fork and make a pull request to the main repo.

A set of actions will run for your pull request. Clicking on "Show all checks" will reveal that one of these is named "Eval script". Clicking on "Details" will take you to the sequence of steps run for the action. Expanding the "Run Eval" stage will show you the results of the eval script.

  <img src="docs/eval_script.png" width="300" /> 
</p>

If you would like to make another submission, you can update the same PR with the new `results.zip` file and the action will run again. You DO NOT need to open a new PR each time.

Please ensure that this is the exact structure of the zip file. The eval script will fail if there are any differences in the names or the structure
```
results.zip
    └── Results
        ├── NLI_EN_HI
        │   └── test_predictions.txt
        ├── QA_EN_HI
        │   └── predictions.json
        .
        .
        .
        └── Sentiment_EN_HI
            └── test_predictions.txt

```
If you would like the result to appear on the leaderboard, please provide the name of your organization, name of the model and a link to a paper about the model along with the PR.
